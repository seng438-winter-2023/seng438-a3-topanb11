# 1 Introduction

For this lab, we will be utilizing white-box testing in order to create test cases that have sufficient statement, branch and condition coverage. The SUT that will be tested are Range and DataUtilities from the JfreeChart package. The goal is to create test cases that yield 90% statement, 70% branch and 60% condition coverage.

# 3 A detailed description of the testing strategy for the new unit test

For testing strategy, we will be utilizing white-box testing since we have access to the source code of the SUT. For testing strategy, we will start by observing the test cases we created previously and if they are up to par with the coverage requirements. Once we are done that, we’ll improve the coverage of any tests that lack sufficient coverage. This will be done by ensuring that all statements are covered, all branches are covered and all conditions are satisfied. This will ensure that we have the highest coverage possible in our test suite.

# 4 A high level description of five selected test cases you have designed using coverage information, and how they have increased code coverage

### expandToInclude()
To ensure there is sufficient coverage for this method, we had to analyze the source code carefully to ensure we are covering all cases. Since this method had multiple if-statements, we created test cases to satisfy all possible conditions so that all branches were covered. Some test cases fulfilled multiple conditions on one run so we were able to write fewer tests while still reaching 100% coverage.

### getCumulativePercentages()
For this method, there were multiple for-loops and if-statements so we had to develop our test cases to ensure all possible statements and branches were covered. However, some statements were impossible to reach which is why the maximum coverage for this method was 83%. For example, for one of the for-loops, the counter is initialized to 0 and there is a conditional that requires the counter to be greater than the size of the array. However, this is impossible since the counter will always be set to 0 so that for-loop and the statements inside including the if-statement will always be missed.

### Constraints() 
For this method, we had to consider all the possible cases that constraint could encounter and to do this we had to analyze the source code directly to make sure that we understood what was occurring when constraint() was called. Initially, we did a simple test for a value that was constrained within the range of the Range object that we were calling. After running this initial test we had 33% branch coverage and 25% line coverage. Afterwards, we included tests that would test within, outside the lower bound, and outside the upper bound of the range object that was being called. This allowed for our coverage to reach 100% in all three cases for Statement, Branch, and Complexity. 

### intersects()
For the intersects method similar to the other methods for Range, the best course of action for us was to analyze the source code and really understand what was going on when calling intersects. We began by considering all the possible states that the intersect function could be called in. After having a clear idea of what these states were, such as a range being above the upper bound or below the lower bound, we were able to make multiple test-cases in order to cover all the lines and branches of the test cases. After running our cases and seeing that some tests were able to cover multiple lines we were able to refine our test-cases down while ensuring that our coverage was still 100% over the 3 different areas. 

### calculateColumnTotal()
This method consisted of a little set up in regards to the variable required for the calculation and then two for loops to iterate through a specified column and calculate the total value of the elements within that column. The first for loop would start at the first column and loop until the row count was met, within the loop there is a if statement that checks for null values before adding the row to the total. Before the white-box testing only one of two branches for the if statement were being tested because none of our test cases provided null values in the Values2D interface mocking. Another test was added during the white-box coverage testing to provide null values which passed and both branches were then covered. The next for loop is for a negative row count, the condition for the loop is r2 > rowCount, where r2 begins as 0. This implies that the rowCount must be less than 0 for the loop to be executed. The second loop made up 25% of the method which meant that only a maximum of 75% statement coverage was possible due to the impossibility of a negative row count.

# 6 Pros and Cons of coverage tools used and Metrics you report

### Pros:
- Eclemma is easy to install and configure, and it provides a user-friendly interface that makes it easy to use.
- Eclemma provides clear and detailed coverage details for several types of coverage such as lines, branch and complexity.
- Eclemma generates automated reports that provide detailed coverage information, making it easier to track progress and identify areas for improvement.
### Cons:
- Eclemma doesn’t support condition coverage which is one of the specific types of coverage we were instructed to test
- Minor inconvenience is that everytime a coverage test is run, the folders in the coverage window close. This requires several specific folders - in the source code to be opened for the detailed percentages and other data.
- Eclemma is designed specifically for Java programming language, so it cannot be used to test code written in other languages.

# 7 A comparison on the advantages and disadvantages of requirements-based test generation and coverage-based test generation.

The main advantage of coverage based tests is the ability to see the source code to get a better understanding of the SUT in order to pinpoint the source of the bug. Another advantage is the ability to discover more edge cases since analyzing source code is possible. One of the disadvantages of coverage-based testing is the time it takes to develop a sufficient number of test cases to maximize statement, branch and conditional coverage. Requirements-based testing is helpful for testing the functionality of a system from a users perspective which means it can find bugs that a user could possibly find. This method of testing is not as comprehensive to the inability to analyze source code.

# 8 A discussion on how the team work/effort was divided and managed

In order to divide the work and effort that each task would take amongst the group members we decided to be similar to previous labs and split into pairs, Jacob/Muhammad and Gabe/Topan. We decided to split up the tests for both pairs to receive a few tests from Range and a few tests from DataUtilities, this ensured the most fairness while working on the assignment as this way each pair was able to work with both the DataUtilitiesTest suite as well as the RangeTest making it more even when separating the work at the end. Additionally, to better engage within the pairs, we used the pair programming methodology while writing our tests to ensure that we met all the requirements for the project. Additionally, we divided up the written report to ensure that each group member was doing ~25% and we would regularly communicate while writing the report to ensure that everyone was on the right track. Lastly, Topan took the role of manager for this assignment, ensuring that timelines and goals were met. He set up our repository and generated the table formats for our reports in the markdown file.

# 9 Any difficulties encountered, challenges overcome, and lessons learned from performing the lab

One difficulty we encountered was that some branches were impossible to reach. This is because for some conditional statements, there is already error-checking prior to the condition, making it impossible to enter the conditional block.

# 10 Comments/feedback on the lab itself

The lab was very straight-forward and it was helpful that all necessary files were provided.
